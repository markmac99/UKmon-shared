Installation
============
If necessary, first install the Visual C redistributable runtime (vc_redist.x86 or 
vc_redist.x64 as appropriate for your platform). 
Then copy the other files in a folder somewhere on your hard drive.

Double-click UkmonliveCL.exe to run it.

Configuration
=============
The programme reads the configuration from your existing UKMONLIVEWatcher.ini 
and AUTH_UKMONLIVEWatcher.ini files so these must exist and contain valid 
security keys and the location of your data. 

Filtering
=========
This version of the software can filter out aircraft, faint meteors and flashes. 
To enable filtering, add two extra rows at the bottom of UKMONLIVEWatcher.ini as explained below.
To disable filtering, either delete the lines or set both values to 0.

Frame limits
----------
The first extra line is the maximum number of frames to consider 'good'
A sensible value is 150. Even fireballs will usually be less than 150 frames while
aircraft trails will usually be longer. Do experiment though. 
Setting the limit to 0 will cause all frame counts to be considered. 
Note also that events of one frame will *aways* be discarded. 

Min Brightness
--------------
The second extra line is the minimum brightness to consider 'good'. 
You'll need to experiment with this. Start with 60 and if its missing too many meteors, 
reduce it till you're happy. 
Setting the value to 0 will cause all brightnesses to be considered. 

Testing
=======
To run in 'dry run' mode - ie will run but not upload anything - pass a parameter T 
eg	"ukmonlivecl.exe T"
To run in debug mode but still upload files, pass a parameter D 
eg 	"ukmonlivecl.exe D"

Both debug modes will generate a lot of verbose output on the screen
