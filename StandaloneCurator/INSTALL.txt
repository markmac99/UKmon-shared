0. INTRODUCTION & PREREQUISITES
===============================
This programme will curate UFOcapture data, moving 'bad' data to a separate folder.
You will need Python 3.x installed, either via Anaconda or via some other mechanism. 
If not using Anaconda, you will also need to install virtualenv. Google will expain how. 

1. CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Create a virtual environment called "ufoCurator" either with Anaconda or with virtualenv.

2. INSTALL SOFTWARE
===================
In your home directory or other location of your choice, create a folder "ufoCurator" to contain 
the programme and expand the zip file into into it. 
You should have a structure like this in the new folder
    CurateUFO.py
    requirements.txt
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOCapXML.py
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOAnalyserXML.py
    CameraCurator/curateCamera.py
    CameraCurator/curateEngine.py
    CameraCurator/curateFolder.py

3. TEST
=======
- Open a command prompt or terminal window on the ufoCurator folder.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Then 
    - for linux or MacOS type 
        chmod +x ./curate.sh
    followed by
        ./curate.sh 

    - for Windows type
        .\curate.ps1 

This will check that all necessary python libraries are installed, and then run the programme and
display the help information.

Now read USAGE.txt to see how to use the  programme.
